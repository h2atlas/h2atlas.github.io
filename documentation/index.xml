      <description>This page is currently under preparation. The full version will be uploaded after our article goes to the public.  Motivation Most of the complex traits have a highly polygenic nature, which means that numerous genes influence the traits.

We analyzed how widely causal variants are spread across the genome for complex traits in the UK biobank.</description>
